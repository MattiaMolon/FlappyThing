# FlappyThing
This is a game coded during my free time. <br />The purpose of it was to understand and learn the Unity engine in order to start 
using it to develop more complex applications. <br />

The game itself is a clone of flappy bird but with some substantial differences:
 * The obstacles that the player will face are of different types.
 * The player doesn't die instantly if he hits one of them. He has a lifebar.
 * Each obstacle deals a specific amount of damage.
 * The player can use different characters to play the game.
 <br />
